# Unused Tests Waiver File
#
# This file contains a list of test directories that are intentionally not included
# in any test suite CSV files. Each entry MUST include a comment explaining why
# the test is excluded.
#
# Format:
#   test_directory_name # REQUIRED: Comment explaining why this test is excluded
#
# Lines starting with # are comments and are ignored.
# Empty lines are ignored.
#
# Examples:
#   deprecated_test # This test is deprecated and will be removed in next release
#   experimental_feature # Under development, not ready for CI
#   manual_test_only # This test requires manual setup and cannot be automated
#
# NOTE: Waiver entries will cause the check to FAIL if:
#   - The justification comment is missing
#   - The test directory does not exist
#   - The test is already being used (unnecessary waiver)
