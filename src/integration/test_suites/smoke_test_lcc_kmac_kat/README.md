## KMAC KAT Smoke Test

This test indirectly tests whether the KMAC instantiated inside the LCC produces the correct output.

The reference hashes are placed as unlock tokens into the `otp-img.2048.vmem` file.
These hashes are generated using the following code snippet inside the `gen_fuse_ctrl_vmem.py` script:
```python
from Crypto.Hash import cSHAKE128

value = int(token_value, 0)
data = value.to_bytes(16, byteorder='little')
custom = 'LC_CTRL'.encode('UTF-8')
shake = cSHAKE128.new(data=data, custom=custom)
digest = int.from_bytes(shake.read(16), byteorder='little')
```

The `smoke_test_lcc_kmac_kat` test writes the unhashed tokens to the LCC which uses the KMAC core to create the hashed tokens.
Then, the test tries several state transitions.
If the state transitions succeed, the hashing was correct.

On each test execution, new unhashed tokens are randomly generated by the `gen_fuse_ctrl_vmem.py` script and placed into the `otp-img.2048.vmem` file as well as the `smoke_test_lcc_kmac_kat.h` header.
